Throughout their schooling, youth are constantly influenced by various factors. When these factors have a negative influence, they are called risk factors. Risk factors increase the likelihood that a student will struggle at school, which can lead to dropping out. Determinants of school perseverance include motivation and engagement, self-esteem, parental supervision, school climate, and community resources.

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Teen pregnancy can pose concerns for students trying to complete high school academic requirements. Nearly one-third of teen girls who drop out of high school state early pregnancy and parenthood as keys reason for their decision, according to TheNationalCampaign.org. Pregnant teens may feel embarrassed about going back to school, struggle with morning sickness or fatigue, and have difficulty keeping up with their classwork. Taking care of a baby is time-consuming, so many may not have the energy to complete high school. Pregnancy also affects college students, but with the availability of online courses and the maturity that comes with adulthood, college-age women often have the opportunity to complete college coursework</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Students often drop out of high school and college due to lack of interest. High school students often report that academic content isn't interesting and they don't have a personal connection with their teachers, according to an article in "Psychology Today." High school dropouts and college students may have other alternatives that seem more appealing, such as getting a job or starting a career. High school students who aren't interested in going to college may not see the value of a high school education. Lack of Interest is a problem that must be addressed by students, parents, school faculty and education boards to see if better course offerings and more student-teacher interactions would help.</p>

Some high school students don't want to risk failing, which could mean summer school or another year of high school.

<br>Unless you have the discipline to set up your own schedule and stick to it, you will get distracted by interruptions. &nbsp;If you get caught up in putting out daily fires, you will fall behind on your milestones. &nbsp;Or, you might feel compelled to sacrifice your personal time to catch up in your research.
Eventually, these conflicts can become too overwhelming, and students think about dropping out of grad school.</p>

Parents play an important role when it comes to high school attendance. High school dropouts often have parents who weren't engaged or concerned with their academic success. If a parent doesn't encourage her child to stay in school, show interest in classes and teachers, communicate with administration, or pay attention to homework assignments, the child might not see any reason to follow through with the coursework. When parents don't prioritize their child's high school education, the child may choose to drop out, according to an article on the United Way website.</div>
