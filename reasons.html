                        Many employers will screen you out entirely because you have no degree—despite your experience. They’ll nearly always take someone with a high school degree over someone without, and often they’ll take someone with an Associate’s before that—even if the job doesn’t necessarily draw on skills you learn in high school or college. More and more, an education is becoming mandatory in our economy.

                                    Even when you get a job, your level of education may hold you back. As the least educated on your team, you could be among the first to go when your company needs to lay off employees. You will have a harder time moving forward in your career without a degree. And once you lose a job, it will be harder to get a new one. High school dropouts are definitely the most vulnerable to losing income and staying in low income brackets in our society.

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">You probably remember times when you were in high school that you wished that you were anywhere but there. It will be that way when you’re in the job market too. There will be various times during your career when you will be just itching to get out, to try something new – or even to take a break from everything for a while. And talk to anyone who is self-employed, and you’ll learn that all of them wanted to quit on themselves on multiple occasions.
<br>
<br>It’s a natural desire, but it’s important to understand that it’s usually only a temporary one. It can often be caused by short-term stresses, and once they have passed, the desire to drop out will disappear. Whatever you do, don’t drop out over problems that will most likely turn out to be temporary. As the saying goes, this too shall pass.</p>

Carefully examine if your desire to drop out may be influenced by one or two friends who have been harboring the same feelings. The combination of school stress and a friend who is contemplating dropping out may be giving the thought exaggerated importance in your mind.
<br>
<br>If you think this is the case, stay clear of that friend for a while, and take up with some other friends who are more enthusiastic. Sometimes it’s just a matter of the company you keep.</p>

                        You may be thinking I just can’t handle this right now, believing that you may be able to return later to complete your education. Don’t be so sure. Understand that life tends to get more complicated as you get older. For example, later in life you may be involved in a serious relationship, or living in an area where you will not be able to complete your education. And should a child come along, your whole game will change. <br><br>A lot of university students drop out and never return. They may have every intention of coming back, but as discussed above, life gets in the way and the planned return never happens.
Your university education is an opportunity that you can and should take advantage of now. You have no idea what the future holds, and an opportunity delayed could be an opportunity lost.<br>
